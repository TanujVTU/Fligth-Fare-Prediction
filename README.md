# Fligth-Fare-Prediction
With the given dataset I am trying to predict the price of the Air Ticket using Machine Learning 
For Data Preprocessing I have benn cleaning the data,so that I could train the model efficiently and increase the accuracy rate.
I have did data preprocessing seperately for both the test and train data set so that the model wouldn't  get overfitted and we could find the correct accuracy of the model using the test dataset as we haven't inserted the same values in train dataset.
